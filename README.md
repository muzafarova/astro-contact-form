# Contact Form

This form collects contact information and sends it to the given email (credentials are in `.env.example`). This demo uses [`nodemailer`](https://www.nodemailer.com/) to facilitate email sending and [Ethernal Email](https://ethereal.email/) as a email transporter. No message gets actually delivered, all messages are caught by the Ethernal Email and can be seen via their dashboard.

Project gets deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

Client-side interactions are implemented with [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) components (TS, composition API). [`Zod`](https://zod.dev/) library is used to validate user input on both server and client side. The form supports autocompletion in the desktop browsers, mobile behavior can vary.

## ðŸš€ Dev setup

This is an [Astro](https://astro.build/) project. See the list of [commands](#-commands) below for all scripts available.

To run the project:

1. Create `.env` file if you wish to enable Ethernal Email (optional step)
2. Install dependencies `npm i`
3. Run dev server `npm run dev`

See [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build) for more details.
